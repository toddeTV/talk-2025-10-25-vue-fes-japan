## dev

### initial setup

#### needed services

For this presentation to fully work you need the following external resources. You can also disable them in the `.env` if you like not to use these parts of the presentation, see comments in `.env` file.

- A running copy of [zlig](https://github.com/toddeTV/zlig) as a Proof of Concept for a fully browser based 3D game.
- A running copy of [stage-flow-tools](https://github.com/toddeTV/stage-flow-tools) for live questions and interactions for the audience.<br>
  Populate Stage Flow Tools with the questions from `assets/stage-flow-tools/data/predefined-questions.json` to get the right polls for this talk. See the project documentation for help.

#### project setup

1. execute a `git pull`
2. open project in VSCode
3. When working in VSCode, install the recommended extensions/ plugins listed in `.vscode/extensions.json` and enable them
4. Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env` and set the environment variables as you like.
5. Install dependencies: `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`.
6. Start dev server with `pnpm dev` (only localhost) or `pnpm dev:network` (exposed to the network).
7. Happy coding <3

### lint and prettier

This project uses lint also for formatting. Read
[why Prettier is not used for every file type](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier) by antfu.

This project uses [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) for eslint most of the files.

Keep in mind that the plugin names are renamed, see
[Plugins Rename](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config?tab=readme-ov-file#plugins-renaming), e.g.:

```diff
-// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions
+// eslint-disable-next-line ts/consistent-type-definitions
type foo = { bar: 2 }
```

### Design

#### used icon collections

This project uses the following icon collections in descending order, try sticking to them and use from top to bottom.
Tipp: Favorite them and use the search over all item collections at once: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?list=favorite
